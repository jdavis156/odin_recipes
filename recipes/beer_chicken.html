    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (approximately 4-5 pounds)</li>
        <li>1 can of beer (12 ounces), half-full</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a charcoal grill, set up for indirect grilling by placing the coals on one side of the grill. If using a gas grill, light the burners on one side only.</li>
        <li>Remove any giblets or excess fat from the chicken cavity.
            Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create a flavorful rub.</li>
        <li>Rub the spice mixture all over the chicken, ensuring it is evenly coated on all sides, including the cavity.</li>
        <li>Open the can of beer and pour out or drink about half of it.</li>
        <li>Create additional openings in the top of the can using a can opener or a church key bottle opener. This allows steam to escape during cooking.</li>
        <li>Carefully lower the chicken onto the half-full beer can, sliding it over the can until the chicken is standing upright with the can inserted into the cavity.</li>
        <li>Place the beer can and chicken directly on the grill grates over indirect heat, ensuring it is stable and balanced.</li>
        <li>Close the grill lid and cook the chicken for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours or until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165°F (74°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the beer can from the chicken using tongs or oven mitts.</li>
         <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let it rest for 10-15 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in a juicier bird.</li>
         <li>Carve the beer can chicken into portions and serve hot alongside your favorite side dishes, such as grilled vegetables, cornbread, or potato salad.</li>
            
    </ol>
