        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>   
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces (or chicken parts of your choice)</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust according to spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, pour buttermilk over the chicken pieces, ensuring they are fully submerged.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. This step helps to tenderize the chicken and infuse it with flavor.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish or large zip-top bag, combine flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create the seasoned coating.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk, allowing any excess liquid to drip off.</li>
        <li>Dredge each piece of chicken in the seasoned flour mixture, ensuring an even and thorough coating. Press the flour mixture onto the chicken to ensure it adheres well.</li>
        <li>In a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven, heat vegetable oil to a temperature of 350째F (175째C). The oil should be deep enough to fully submerge the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the coated chicken pieces in the hot oil, skin side down, without overcrowding the pan</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for about 12-15 minutes per side or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) and the coating turns golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, use tongs to transfer the fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the crispy fried chicken hot, accompanied by your favorite side dishes such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or cornbread.</li>
        
    </ol>
