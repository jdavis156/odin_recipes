    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
   <div><ul><em>
        <li>2 racks of baby back ribs (about 4 pounds)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon parprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust according to spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup BBQ sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
    </em></ul></div>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>1 cup BBQ sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
        <li>Remove the thin membrane from the back of the ribs by lifting it with a knife or a spoon and peeling it off.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create a flavorful dry rub</li>
        <li>Evenly coat both sides of the ribs with the dry rub, gently massaging it into the meat. Ensure complete coverage for maximum flavor</li>
        <li>Place the ribs on the grill, bone side down, away from direct heat if using a charcoal grill. If using a gas grill, turn off the burners directly below the ribs.</li>
        <li>Close the grill lid and let the ribs cook for approximately 2.5 to 3 hours or until the meat is tender. Maintain a consistent temperature of around 275째F (135째C).</li>
        <li>During the last 30 minutes of cooking, brush a generous amount of BBQ sauce on both sides of the ribs. Apply multiple layers for a sticky and flavorful glaze.</li>
        <li>To test the ribs for doneness, use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 190째F (88째C).</li>
        <li>Remove the ribs from the grill and let them rest for 5-10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute and the meat to become even more tender.</li>
        <li>Slice the ribs between the bones and serve them hot. Garnish with fresh herbs or a sprinkle of the dry rub for an extra touch of flavor.</li>
               
    </ol>
